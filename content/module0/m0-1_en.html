<h2>1.2. A note on terminology</h2>

<p><strong>Indigenous versus Aboriginal</strong></p>
<p>The terms “Indigenous Peoples” and “Aboriginal peoples” refer to the same group. However, they are not
    interchangeable within the legal context.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The term “Aboriginal” has specific meaning and legal accuracy in the context of section 35 of
        the <em>Constitution Act, 1982</em>, which states that Aboriginal peoples “include the Indian, Inuit and
        Métis peoples of Canada.”</li>
    <li>Unlike the term “Aboriginal peoples”, “Indigenous Peoples” has not been legally defined in statute or by the
        courts in Canada. However, the Government of Canada generally uses the term “Indigenous Peoples” to refer to
        the First Nations, Inuit and Métis of Canada.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What terminology will be used in this course?</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that the terminology is used consistently and aligns with that of the federal government, the term
    “Indigenous” will be used throughout the course. “Aboriginal” will be maintained if it is part of a strategy,
    policy or agreement title.</p>
