<h3>4.1.1. Determining if a modern treaty/CLCA applies</h3><p>For every requirement, business owners must find out if it is subject to a modern treaty/CLCA. If it is, the requirement and upcoming procurement activities may be impacted. Play a supporting role by ensuring this task has been completed and make sure you are informed of its outcome.</p><p><strong>Situations where a modern treaty/CLCA would apply</strong></p><p>- The deliverable, or a portion of the deliverable includes final delivery of or performance in or into a location covered by a modern treaty/CLCA area. Note that the final delivery point is not necessarily the destination addresses detailed in the requisition, nor the origin of the requisition such as the ordering office.</p><p>- A procurement is in support of government activities within a modern treaty/CLCA area.</p><p>- A procurement involves the performance of services or associated travel by the resulting contractor within a CLCA area.</p><p><strong>Overlapping modern treaties/CLCAs</strong></p><table width="100%">

                <p>It is&nbsp;a web-based information system that you can use&nbsp;to&nbsp;determine if any modern treaty/CLCA applies to the procurement. It also:</p>
                <p>· displays information relating to potential or established treaty rights;</p>
                <p>· locates Indigenous communities in and around modern treaty/CLCA&nbsp;areas;</p>
                <p>· provides contact information for chiefs and band offices.</p>

    <li>Go to the ATRIS search page and click on&nbsp;<em>Go to ATRIS</em>. For best results, use the Chrome Browser&nbsp;or Internet Edge.</li>
    <li>Scroll down and click on&nbsp;<em>Accept</em>&nbsp;to access the ATRIS search page.</li>
    <li>On the&nbsp;<em>Search By</em>&nbsp;drop-down list, you can search by&nbsp;<em>Map Coordinate</em>,&nbsp;<em>Postal Code</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Place Name</em>&nbsp;to determine the applicability of a&nbsp;modern treaty. It is highly recommended that you search by&nbsp;<em>Postal Code</em>, and&nbsp;add a buffer of at least 50&nbsp;km to ensure that nearby modern treaties are captured.</li>
    <li>Enter the postal code (X0E 0A0) and 50&nbsp;km buffer, then click on Search to view the results.</li>
    <li>The&nbsp;applicable modern treaties are listed on the right hand side.</li>
    <li><strong>If&nbsp;the procurement is within 50&nbsp;km of the postal code</strong>, the obligations of the Gwich'in Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement&nbsp;and Inuvialuit Final Agreement apply. Note that the list also shows Treaty #11. It is a historic treaty, not a modern treaty. You can disregard the historic treaty and deselect it from the list. What is left are the areas covered by the applicable modern treaties. In this case, they are displayed in black and orange.</li>
    <li>The flag indicates the location of the postal code. If you zoom in, you will see that it falls on an area covered by the&nbsp;Inuvialuit Final Agreement.&nbsp;<strong>If the postal code is the final delivery point,</strong>&nbsp;then only the obligations of the&nbsp;Inuvialuit Final Agreement apply.</li>
    <li>Whether the procurement falls on a modern treaty area or not, always ask yourself if the procurement may be impacting other Indigenous groups living outside of the final delivery point.</li>
</ol><p>The answer to this question is very important. Why? Because there is an obligation to consult all Indigenous groups, including those living outside of the applicable modern treaty areas, that may be&nbsp;adversely&nbsp;affected by the procurement.</p><ol start="9">
    <li>Use&nbsp;ATRIS as a preliminary research tool, but remember to always seek confirmation and guidance from&nbsp;ISC or your&nbsp;departmental Indigenous procurement&nbsp;team. They will be able to confirm the applicability and obligations of modern treaties and other considerations that may not be displayed on ATRIS.</li>
