<h4>Applicability</h4>
<p><strong>Determining if a modern treaty/CLCA applies</strong></p>
<p>For every requirement, business owners must find out if it is subject to a modern treaty/CLCA. If it is, the
    requirement and upcoming procurement activities may be impacted. Play a supporting role by ensuring that this
    task has been completed and make sure you are informed of its outcome.</p>
<p><strong>Situations where a modern treaty/CLCA would apply</strong></p>
<p>See slide 29 for display/interaction example.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The deliverable, or a portion of the deliverable includes final delivery of or performance in or into a
        location covered by a modern treaty/CLCA area. Note that the final delivery point is not necessarily the
        destination addresses detailed in the requisition, nor the origin of the requisition such as the ordering
        office.</li>
    <li>A procurement is in support of government activities within a modern treaty/CLCA area.</li>
    <li>A procurement involves the performance of services or associated travel by the resulting contractor within a
        CLCA area.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Overlapping modern treaties/CLCAs</strong></p>
<p>There are geographic areas where more than one modern treaty/CLCA can apply. If a procurement includes the final
    delivery to or performance in a settlement area covered by more than one modern treaty/CLCA, the obligations of
    all applicable&nbsp;modern treaties/CLCAs apply.</p>

<p><strong>Example of overlapping modern treaties/CLCAs</strong></p>
<p>See slide 66 for display/interaction example.</p>
<p>Inuvik, Northwest Territories is situated within the settlement areas of both the Inuvialuit Final Agreement and
    the Gwich'in&nbsp;CLCA. The contracting obligations of both&nbsp;modern treaties/CLCAs would apply to the portion of
    the
    procurement with deliveries to Inuvik.</p>

<h4>2.5.2.1.&nbsp; Using ATRIS to determine the applicability of a modern treaty/CLCA</h4>
<p>Press play to learn how to use ATRIS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span class="ProgNote">Script for tutorial video – to be developed by Sandbox</span></p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the ATRIS search page and click on <em>Go to ATRIS</em>. For best results, use the Chrome Browser or
        Internet Edge.</li>
    <li>Scroll down and click on <em>Accept</em> to access the ATRIS search page.</li>
    <li>On the <em>Search By</em> drop-down list, you can search by <em>Map Coordinate</em>, <em>Postal Code</em> or
        <em>Place Name</em> to determine the applicability of a modern treaty. It is highly recommended that you
        search by <em>Postal Code</em>, and add a buffer of at least 50&nbsp;km to ensure that nearby modern treaties
        are
        captured.</li>
    <li>Enter the postal code (X0E 0A0) and 50&nbsp;km buffer, then click on Search to view the results.</li>
    <li>The applicable modern treaties are listed on the right hand side.</li>
    <li><strong>If the procurement is within 50&nbsp;km of the postal code</strong>, the obligations of the Gwich'in
        Comprehensive Land Claim Agreement&nbsp;and Inuvialuit Final Agreement apply. Note that the list also shows
        Treaty #11. It is a historic treaty, not a modern treaty. You can disregard the historic treaty and deselect
        it from the list. What is left are the areas covered by the applicable modern treaties. In this case, they
        are displayed in black and orange.</li>
    <li>The flag indicates the location of the postal code. If you zoom in, you will see that it falls on an area
        covered by the Inuvialuit Final Agreement. <strong>If the postal code is the final delivery point,</strong>
        then only the obligations of the Inuvialuit Final Agreement apply.</li>
    <li>Whether the procurement falls on a modern treaty area or not, always ask yourself if the procurement may be
        impacting other Indigenous groups living outside of the final delivery point.</li>
</ol>
<p>The answer to this question is very important. Why? Because there is an obligation to consult all Indigenous
    groups, including those living outside of the applicable modern treaty areas, that may be adversely affected by
    the procurement.</p>
<ol start="9">
    <li>Use ATRIS as a preliminary research tool, but remember to always seek confirmation and guidance from ISC or
        your departmental Indigenous procurement team. They will be able to confirm the applicability and
        obligations of modern treaties and other considerations that may not be displayed on ATRIS. &nbsp;</li>
