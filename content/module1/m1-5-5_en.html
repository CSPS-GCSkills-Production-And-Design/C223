    </table><p>All methods of supply for federal procurement may be employed under modern treaties/CLCAs, provided the
        obligations of the applicable modern treaty/CLCA have been addressed.</p><p>For request for standing offers (RFSO), request for supply arrangements (RFSA) and contracts with task
        authorization (TA), the following instrument options can be established:&nbsp;</p><ul>
        <li>An instrument that provides for both modern treaty areas and non-modern treaty areas;</li>
        <li>Two streams of instruments - one for modern treaty areas and one for non-modern treaty areas; or</li>
        <li>Multiple streams for various geographic or modern treaty areas.</li>
    </ul><p>Read through the existing mandatory SOs or SAs. If they do not fulfill the obligations of the applicable modern
        treaty (CLCA), you are exempted from having to use them. Establish a separate contract, SO or SA, that addresses
        your requirement.</p>
