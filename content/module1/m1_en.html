</table><p>Modern treaties/CLCAs are legal agreements that define the&nbsp;ongoing legal, political and economic relationships between the signatories.&nbsp;They provide clarity and predictability with respect to land and resources rights, ownership and management.</p><p>As of July 2020, there are 25 modern treaties/CLCAs in effect and 22 contain measures that affect procurement.</p><p><strong>Map of Canada’s modern treaties/CLCAs</strong></p><p>Click on a location to view which modern treaty/CLCA applies.</p><p>[Interactive map needs to be updated and redesigned to comply with accessibility standards]</p><p><strong>Impact of modern treaties/CLCAs on procurement activities.<br></strong>If a procurement, or a portion thereof, includes the final delivery to or performance in a settlement area covered by a modern treaty/CLCA, the procurement obligations of that treaty will apply to the associated portion of the procurement. For this reason, business owners and contracting authorities have a legal duty to fulfill the obligations of any applicable treaty.</p><p>Each modern treaty/CLCA is different, which means you&nbsp;have to understand the obligations of each treaty to determine how they impact your procurement activities.</p><p>Business owners and contracting authorities should also be aware that associated Impact and Benefit Agreements (IBA) may also affect the procurement process.&nbsp;These are formal contracts that lay out a project between a community and a corporate or government project, and explain the implications of the project with respect to human capital development, economic development, social development, culture, and environment.&nbsp;Each one is unique and you should&nbsp;contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:aadnc.cau-uca.aandc@canada.ca">Indigenous Services Canada</a>&nbsp;(ISC)&nbsp;to determine whether an Impact and Benefit Agreement applies to your procurement.&nbsp;</p>
