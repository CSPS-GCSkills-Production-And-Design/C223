<h2>2.12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Post-award audits</h2><p>When bidding is restricted to modern treaty/CLCA beneficiaries, it is essential that the contractor continues to
        meet the definition of a modern treaty/CLCA business throughout the life of the contract.</p><p>To ensure contractors are compliant with that contractual obligation, post-award audits are performed on a random
        basis by ISC or upon your request if you believe that the contractor’s continued status as a modern treaty/CLCA
        business is uncertain.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>What to expect during post-award audits</strong></p><p><span class="ProgNote">Decision tree – to be designed by graphic designer</span></p><ol>
