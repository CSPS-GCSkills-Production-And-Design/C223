<h3>2.6.3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trade agreements</h3><p>In general, federal procurements must comply with procedural obligations of the trade agreements. However, all of Canadaâ€™s trade agreements contain exceptions that allow special measures to be taken for the benefit of Indigenous people or businesses. Thus, if a procurement is set-aside or contains measures adopted or maintained with respect to Indigenous peoples, some or all aspects of the procurement may not be subject to trade agreements obligations.</p><hr><p><strong>What happens if your procurementhas a right of first refusal?</strong></p><p>If the procurement has a right of first refusal, then you can restrict the procurement to the applicable modern treaty/CLCA beneficiaries. The entire procurement process is then set aside from &nbsp;the trade agreement obligations, and the procurement no longer falls under the jurisdiction of the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT).</p><hr><p><strong>What happens if your procurement contains measures for Indigenous peoples?</strong></p><p>If the procurement is not reserved for modern treaty/CLCA beneficiaries because of a right of first refusal, but contains measures for Indigenous peoples and businesses such as a PSAB set-aside or the inclusion of an IBP in the evaluation criteria, trade agreements obligations do not apply to these portions of the procurement. Any measures adopted or maintained with respect to Indigenous peoples are not subject to CITT review, although the rest of the procurement process must be conducted in compliance with trade agreement provisions and is reviewable by the CITT.</p>
