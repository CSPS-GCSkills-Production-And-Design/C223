    </table><p>Modern treaties/CLCAs are legal agreements that define the ongoing legal, political and economic relationships
        between the signatories. They provide clarity and predictability with respect to land and resources rights,
        ownership and management.</p><p>As of July 2020, there are 25 modern treaties/CLCAs in effect and 22 contain measures that affect procurement. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            display example</em></p><p>If a procurement, or a portion thereof, includes the final delivery to or performance in a settlement area
        covered by a modern treaty/CLCA, the procurement obligations of that treaty will apply to the associated portion
        of the procurement. For this reason, business owners and contracting authorities have a legal duty to fulfill
        the obligations of any applicable treaty.</p><p>Each modern treaty/CLCA is different, which means you have to understand the obligations of each treaty to
        determine how they impact your procurement activities.</p><p>Business owners and contracting authorities should also be aware that associated Impact and Benefit Agreements
        (IBA) may also affect the procurement process.&nbsp;These are formal contracts that lay out a project between a
        community and a corporate or government project, and explain the implications of the project with respect to
        human capital development, economic development, social development, culture, and environment.&nbsp;Each one is
        unique and you should contact <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-3" class="external" target="_blank">Indigenous Services Canada</a>
        (ISC)&nbsp;to determine whether an Impact and Benefit Agreement applies to your procurement.&nbsp;</p>
