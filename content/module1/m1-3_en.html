<h2>2.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The procurement process</h2><p>If a procurement, or a portion thereof, includes the final delivery or performance of the goods, services or
        construction to a settlement area covered by a particular modern treaty/CLCA, expect the applicable procurement
        obligations of that treaty to change the way you typically carry out some of your procurement activities.</p><p><strong>Steps impacted by the applicability of Modern Treaties/CLCAs&nbsp; </strong></p><p><em>See slide 64, 82 and 84 for display example</em></p><p>Below are the steps that you must follow to procure goods and services that are subject to a Modern Treaty/CLCA.
    </p><ul>
        <li>Since the procurement process was covered with the <a href="#" data-ext="wb-ext-4" class="external" target="_blank">M501 â€“ The procurement
                process</a> course, this section will only present the steps where considerations related to modern
            treaties/CLCAs might apply.</li>
        <li>The steps identified with a <span class="ProgNote">*<em>star</em></span> are not impacted by the
            applicability of modern treaties/CLCAs. Proceed as you normally would. <em><span class="ProgNote">Caroline -
