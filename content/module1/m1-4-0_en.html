                <p>The answer is : Provide guidance and advice</p>
                <p><strong>Being the trusted advisor.</strong></p>
                <p>Your level of involvement during this step will depend on the business owner’s level of experience with procurement and on the complexity of the requirement. The business owner might not know about modern treaties/CLCAs and may rely on your knowledge to ensure the applicable obligations are met.</p>
                <p>Because modern treaty/CLCA obligations affect many phases of the procurement process, it is also to your advantage to be informed and involved early so you can plan and adapt your procurement activities accordingly.</p>
