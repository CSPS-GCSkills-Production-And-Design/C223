<h2>2.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solicitation documents</h2><p>Once the procurement strategy is developed and approved, your next step is to finalize your solicitation documents. This section will cover important considerations to keep in mind as you prepare them.</p><hr><p><strong>Indigenous economic measures : it is your responsibility to clearly define expectations.</strong></p><p>Remember – procurements subject to modern treaties/CLCAs may require socio-economic benefits to communities and businesses living and operating in that area if capacity exists.</p><p>As a best practice, consider the following:</p><ul>
    <li>If an IBP or socio-economic benefits plan is required, ensure that bidders have enough information to integrate it as part of their bid.</li>
    <li>Include clauses requiring the resulting contractor to report on the achievement of their socio-economic benefits.</li>
    <li>Use plain language to ensure your bid solicitation documents are easy to understand.</li>
</ul><hr><p><strong>Insert appropriate clauses, terms and conditions</strong></p><p>When a procurement is subject to a modern treaty/CLCA, make sure your solicitation documents and the notices on the Government Electronic Tendering Service (GETS) contain the appropriate clauses, terms and conditions. This information will:</p><ul>
    <li>enable potential Indigenous and non-Indigenous bidders to quickly determine their eligibility to bid and;</li>
    <li>inform potential bidders of legal obligations that might impact the content of their bid.</li>
