</table><p><strong>Solicitation methods</strong></p><p>Select the appropriate solicitation method to request bids or proposals from potential suppliers.</p><p>Due to the remoteness of some of the modern treaty/CLCA areas and limited access to means of communication, consider advertising procurement opportunities in local newspapers and other public venues such as community and recreation centres.</p><p><strong>Notification of procurement </strong></p><p>As part of the modern treaty obligations, notification to claimant groups may be required for any modern treaty/CLCA related procurement. Whether the procurement is posted on GETS or not, the following process should be followed to notify claimant groups and beneficiary businesses:</p><table>

            <td width="208">
                <p>Notify claimant groups</p>

        <tr>
            <td width="208">
                <p>On the day of issuing the solicitation, send the applicable land claimant group(s) a notice describing the procurement. It should contain the same information that an Advanced Contract Award Notice (ACAN), Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP), Letter of Interest (LOI) and Price and Availability (P&amp;A) enquiry would have contained.</p>
            </td>
            <td width="208">
                <p>Use the business lists or directories to invite modern treaty/CLCA&nbsp;beneficiary businesses to submit a bid. This must not restrict the ability of any other beneficiary businesses, not on the list, to submit a bid.</p>
            </td>
            <td width="208">
                <p>Allow at least 15 calendar days to allow potential bidders to submit any enquiries.</p>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table><p>Note that notification is not required for individual call-ups against a SO or SA, as notification at the RFSO and RFSA stage is sufficient.</p><p><strong>Solicitation periods</strong></p><p>Again, due to the remoteness of some of the modern treaty/CLCA areas, limited access to technology and poor weather conditions which may slow down the submission of bids by mail or courier, consider allowing for a longer bidding period of 15 to up to 40 days.</p><p>Remember to align your procurement timing with important local events such as hunting seasons and local weather conditions.</p>
