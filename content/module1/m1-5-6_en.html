<h3>2.6.7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Procurement schedule</h3><p>As you develop your procurement schedule, think about the applicable modern treaty/CLCA obligations, and consider
        how they might impact your procurementâ€™s timelines.</p><ul>
        <li>Note whether simultaneous procurement activities or important local events such as hunting seasons and local
            weather conditions could impact your procurement schedule. Make use of that information and adjust your
            timelines accordingly.</li>
        <li>For modern treaty/CLCA procurement, allow for additional time since most requirements are subject to the
            obligation to provide notification of the procurement to the applicable land claimant groups, including for
            sole-source requirements.</li>
